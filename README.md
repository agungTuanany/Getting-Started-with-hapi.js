This repo contains all the code examples for the book [Getting Started with hapijs](http://bit.ly/start-with-hapi) by [John Brett](https://github.com/johnbrett). 

Regardless of whether you've read the book or not, I'd like this repo to be a location for useful examples, explanations and discussions for anything hapi related.

If you have questions on any of the code examples above, or have a request for some sample applications on how you might use hapi for something like a react or angular based app or integrating with a certain data source let me know and I can put one together!
